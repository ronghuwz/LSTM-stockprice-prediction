# LSTM-stockprice_prediction
Using LSTM to make predictions on the stock price.

This project is focused on predicting future stock prices using past data. 
First, choose a range of your choice on the stock price data and download the data in.csv format.
(For example you can download the dataset from: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history/)
Then create an LSTM model to make predictions on future stock prices and 
compare it with the true value.
